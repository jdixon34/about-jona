    <h1>About Jona - Super Yogi Musician and Singer/Songwriter</h1>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>
            Hi my name is Jonathan, but I go by Jona. It's a stage name for my music career that I am
            still trying to get off the ground. I've been a singer-songwriter/bedroom producer for
            about 7 years now. I've been playing guitar for about 10 years now, and I only learned
            because of a girl. After falling in love with guitar I became obsessed with music.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then in 2019 I released a debut album titled, "Simple Mind". I recorded, performed, and
            produced the entire album by myself, with the exception of using a Garage band for their
            drum samples and drum machine. I then spent about a year or two in the Albuquerque music
            scene and had the surprise of my life. The birth of my baby boy, "Kaladin", is what drives
            me today. That is the whole reason why I'm in this bootcamp because I know I can do a web
            developers job.

            Also, I am an <b>ultra-marathon runner</b> and I used to compete in the <em>Ironman races</em>.
            I can run at crazy speed because I train high up there in the Sandia mountains. Whenever I come across a
            wild mountain lion, I just <b>speed-climb</b> up a tree! It's quite <em>SENSATIONAL!</em>
        </p>

            My secret to such performance is this: Once I was hiking in the Himalayas I met an ascetic. He taught me
            sacred meditation techniques that enhance both your mental and physical performance. I plan to work
            on a meditation album as well, as it helped me in my creative processes. This holy man from the Himalayas
            also taught me extreme forms of Hatha Yoga that I still practice today. When my son is old enough, I will
            teach him all about the sacred meditations and Yoga asanas that I learned from the holy man in the Himalayas.</p>

            <h2>However, there is a special order which one needs to follow:</h2>
            <ul class="center-list">
            <li class="yoga-list">First come the Kriyas.</li>
            <li class="yoga-list">Then the conditioning accompanied by a prayer.</li>
            <li class="yoga-list">Followed by the extreme practices of Asanas.</li>
            <li class="yoga-list">And finally, I end my extreme practice with Pranayamas which can be dangerous if
                you don't know what you are doing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Thankfully, I <b>DO!</b></h3>
