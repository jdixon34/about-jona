            Hi my name is Jonathan, but I go by Jona. It's a stage name for my music career that I am
            still trying to get off the ground. I've been a singer-songwriter/bedroom producer for
            about 7 years now. I've been playing guitar for about 10 years now, and I only learned
            because of a girl. After falling in love with guitar I became obsessed with music.
        </p>
        <p>
            Than in 2019 I released a debut album titled, "Simple Mind". I recorded, performed, and
            produced the entire album by myself, with the exception of using Garage band for their
            drum samples and drum machine. I then spent about a year or two in the Albuquerque music
            scene and had the surprise of my life. The birth of my baby boy, "Kaladin", is what drives
            me today. That is the whole reason why I'm in this bootcamp because I know I can do a web
            developers job.

            Also, I am an <b>ultra-marathon runner</b> and I used to compete in the <em>Ironman races</em>.
            I can run at crazy speed because I train high up there in the Sandia mountains. Whenever I come across a
            wild mountain lion, I just <b>speed-climb</b> up a tree! It's quite <em>SENSATIONAL!</em>
